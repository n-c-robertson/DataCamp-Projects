# Datacamp Projects

A series of finished Jupyter notebooks with solutions to projects provided by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects), a site that teaches Python, R, and SQL skills for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers.

The notebooks were designed by DataCamp. All solutions are my own.
